# RTL-Verification-of-Half-Adder-Using-SystemVerilog-Testbench
Developed a SystemVerilog-based testbench to functionally verify the RTL implementation of a Half Adder.
Designed a modular verification environment including stimulus generation, DUT instantiation, and output monitoring.
Implemented directed and randomized test cases to validate all possible input combinations.
Created self-checking logic by comparing DUT outputs against expected reference results.
Ensured functional correctness of SUM and CARRY outputs through exhaustive simulation.
Used $display and assertions for real-time debugging and error detection during simulation.
Verified the design using EDA Playground, ensuring portability and reproducibility of results.
Followed industry-standard RTL verification practices using SystemVerilog constructs.
